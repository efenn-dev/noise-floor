# Devlog

Newest first. One entry per milestone: what was built, how to try it, known gaps, next.

## 2026-10-12 — M0 Skeleton

**Built:** Godot 4.7 project; greybox town (road, 12 block houses, 4 cars, the factory at the north end) built in code (`src/world/main.gd`); day/night sun + moon driven by `GameClock` (`src/sim/game_clock.gd`: 1 real minute = 1 hour, sun up 05:00–21:00); zero-dependency headless test runner (18 checks); screenshot tool; cloud bootstrap hook that installs pinned Godot + Xvfb/Mesa.

**Verified on Emmitt's PC:** `tools/test.sh` green; runner correctly reports a failing check and a crashing test; screenshots render in both Forward+ and the Compatibility renderer (the one cloud sessions use); nights are properly dark.

**Not yet verified:** the cloud bootstrap itself. The first cloud session should confirm the `cloud-setup:` status line says `ok` for both Godot and screenshots.

**Try it on the PC:** `C:/projects/Godot_v4.7-stable_win64.exe/Godot_v4.7-stable_win64.exe --path C:/projects/noise-floor` (camera is fixed; time passes at 1 hour per minute).

**Next:** M1 — Walk the town.
