Newest first. One entry per milestone: what was built, how to try it, known gaps, next.

## 2026-10-12 — M3 Machines and belts

**Built:** three new things in build mode: **3 belt**, **4 smelter**, **5 press**. They sit on foundations and face away from you (R turns them). A machine takes items in at its back (blue port) and pushes products out of its front (orange port). Belts carry items forward and can turn corners. The **Smelter** turns 1 scrap metal into 1 metal plate every 2 s; the **Press** turns 1 plate into 4 nails every 2 s. A lamp on each machine glows green while it works and amber when its output is full. Look at a machine (not in build mode) to see what's in it; **E** takes its output and loads it with what it needs from your pockets. E on a belt picks up the items on it. Removing a machine or belt gives back its build cost *and* everything inside it.

**Rules (sim, tested):** `Factory` (`src/sim/factory.gd`) with machines and belts on the fixed tick. Belts run at 1 cell (2 m) per second with items at least a quarter-cell apart. Each tick moves every item first, then does hand-offs, so results don't depend on build order. Recipes live in `data/recipes.json`, machines and belts in `data/buildables.json`, and item colours in `data/items.json`.

**Tests:** 169 checks. The M3 proof: smelter → 3 belts → press, hand-fed 10 scrap, gives 10 plates and then 40 nails within 28 s, with exactly 7 plates at 15 s. Also: belt speed (3 cells in 3 s), corners, no feeding a belt head-on, no feeding a machine from its side, belts backing up without overlap, output-full stop, input caps, refunds of contents including a half-made item, identical results whatever the frame rate, and a world test of looking at a machine, pressing E and seeing items drawn on belts.

**Try it on the PC:** merge, `git pull`, launch. Press B and build a row of foundations (1), a smelter (4) facing along the row, belts (3) after it, and a press (5) at the end. Press B to leave build mode, look at the smelter and press E to load scrap. Or launch with `-- --demo-factory` for a ready-made line.

**Known gaps:** each machine has one fixed recipe (no recipe picker yet); no splitters or mergers; no storage box at the end of a line; machines don't need power yet (M7) and aren't loud yet (M5); you can't place items onto a belt by hand.

**Next:** M4, the dead (zombies).

## 2026-10-12 — M2 Build

**Built:** press **B** for build mode. A see-through ghost snaps to the 2 m grid where you aim: green means you can build, red means you can't, and the HUD says why ("Needs a foundation", "Not enough materials", "Something's in the way"). **1** picks foundation, **2** picks wall, **R** turns the wall to the next edge of the square, **left-click** builds, **right-click** removes what you're looking at with a full refund. Your materials show top right; you start with a debug kit (100 planks, 100 nails, 20 scrap). Foundations are low enough to walk onto; walls are solid.

**Rules (sim, tested):** `Inventory` (all-or-nothing payments), `GameData` (loads and checks `data/items.json`, `data/buildables.json`, `data/debug_kit.json`), `BuildGrid` (grid snapping, walls need a foundation on one side, an edge shared by two squares holds only one wall, you can't pull a foundation out from under a wall, 100% refunds). Physics layers: built pieces are on their own layer so they never count as "in the way" of each other.

**Tests:** 120 checks. New: inventory, data validation (including a deliberately broken file), the build rules, and a scripted physics run: aim, build, wall on top, remove both, crate blocks placement, can't build under yourself, player walks up onto foundations and is stopped by a wall. Also a check that `main.gd` compiles, after a typo in it slipped past the tests once.

**Also:** fixed dark stripes the flashlight's shadow made on flat walls.

**Try it on the PC:** merge, `git pull`, launch, press B, look at the ground and left-click. Press 2 for walls and build them on the edges of your foundations.

**Known gaps:** no build menu yet (number keys only); no doorways, doors, windows or stairs (doors and barricades come in M8); nothing saves (M9); materials only come from the debug kit until scavenging (M6); foundations only sit at ground level (no stacking or second floors).

**Next:** M3, machines and belts.

## 2026-10-12 — M1 Walk the town

**Built:** first-person `Player` (`src/world/player.gd`): WASD, mouse look, Shift sprint, Space jump, Ctrl/C crouch (won't stand up under a low ceiling), F flashlight, Esc frees the mouse and a click grabs it back. Input keys are registered in one place (`src/world/input_setup.gd`). New `SimWorld` (`src/sim/sim_world.gd`) steps all game rules on a fixed 20-per-second tick; the clock now runs there, and later systems (machines, noise, zombies) hook into `SimWorld.step()`. HUD shows day + clock, a centre dot and a key-hint line. New screenshot flags `--cam=X,Y,Z,YAW,PITCH` and `--flashlight`.

**Tests:** 39 checks. New: fixed-tick determinism (same result however frames are sliced), and a scripted physics run proving the player walks forward, sprints faster, crouches slower, jumps and lands, is **blocked by a wall**, and stays crouched under a low slab. The test runner now supports tests that `await` physics frames.

**Cloud bootstrap verified:** first cloud session; the setup hook printed `godot 4.7-stable ok | screenshots ok`, tests and screenshots work in the cloud.

**Try it on the PC:** pull/merge, then `C:/projects/Godot_v4.7-stable_win64.exe/Godot_v4.7-stable_win64.exe --path C:/projects/noise-floor`. Click into the window, walk around, wait for night (about 11 real minutes from the 08:00 start, or launch with `-- --time=20`) and press F.

**Known gaps:** mouse sensitivity is fixed (settings come in M9); no stamina yet (sprint is unlimited until M6); no footstep sounds; nothing to do in town yet. Flashlight and lighting were tuned on the cloud's flat software renderer, so they may look brighter on the PC.

**Next:** M2 — Build.

## 2026-10-12 — M0 Skeleton

**Built:** Godot 4.7 project; greybox town (road, 12 block houses, 4 cars, the factory at the north end) built in code (`src/world/main.gd`); day/night sun + moon driven by `GameClock` (`src/sim/game_clock.gd`: 1 real minute = 1 hour, sun up 05:00–21:00); zero-dependency headless test runner (18 checks); screenshot tool; cloud bootstrap hook that installs pinned Godot + Xvfb/Mesa.

**Verified on Emmitt's PC:** `tools/test.sh` green; runner correctly reports a failing check and a crashing test; screenshots render in both Forward+ and the Compatibility renderer (the one cloud sessions use); nights are properly dark.

**Not yet verified:** the cloud bootstrap itself. The first cloud session should confirm the `cloud-setup:` status line says `ok` for both Godot and screenshots.

**Try it on the PC:** `C:/projects/Godot_v4.7-stable_win64.exe/Godot_v4.7-stable_win64.exe --path C:/projects/noise-floor` (camera is fixed; time passes at 1 hour per minute).

**Next:** M1 — Walk the town.
